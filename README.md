# whitelist-generator

Simple script to create white list of the mail servers of big
companies who won't comply with the RFCs â€” for obvious reasons.


Grey listing is a very effective anti spam mechanism. The RFC states
that any message that is not accepted should be tried again in a few
minutes. Usually after a second attempt a grey filtering host accepts
the message. Spam bots don't have time to go through those procedures
and will not retry.

On the other hand, big companies like gmail and hotmail have to deal
with massive volumes of mail and also don't retry sending emails.

To create a whitelist for those hosts this script checks their usually
well maintained spf record. An spf record is stored in the txt record for dns.

Here is a complete syntax description for spf records:
